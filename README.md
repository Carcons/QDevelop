# QDevelop
Very simple C++ IDE built using Qt5

This was one of my first ever C++ program, and the absolute first one built using both C++ and Qt.
It was built as a University project.
Lot of bugs and bad architecture, but still something cool to keep alive somewere, as it (maybe) could still contain some cool trick about UI design using C++ and Qt.
